# Operands, Operators, and Parentheses! On My!


## First iteration:

- Use each of the numbers 1, 3, 4, and 6 only once
- Use any combination of the four operators +, -, /, *
- Address all the possible order of operations using ()
- Find all the resulting expressions that equal 24

Example, `3 * (4 + 6) + 1` is a valid expression but doesn't equal 24.


## Second iteration:

- Now accept any input for the numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Accept any desired output (e.g. 15)
- Show the total number of possible expressions
- Show how many equal the desired output
- Graph the solutions on an X/Y graph where:
    - X is the # of the permutation
    - Y is the result of the expression
- Address error handling
- Benchmark your program to find out the average execution time per iteration
