# Filling bottles of water


1. You have 100 empty bottles
1. All bottles are sealed with a screw on cap
1. It takes 20 seconds to fill each bottle with water
1. You can only fill 1 bottle at a time
1. It takes you exactly 3 seconds to unscrew the cap of a bottle and place it under the water
1. It takes you exactly 3 seconds to screw the cap back on
1. While the bottle is filling with water your hands are free
1. While a bottle is filling you're free to unscrew sealed bottles and seal up open bottles
1. You absolutely cannot let water overflow a bottle. The bottle must be swapped once it is full.
1. Determine the amount of "down" time that will be spent watching bottles fill without being productive (opening/closing bottles)
